    <h1 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Espen Hundvins' helicopter training resources</h1>

    <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Description</h3>
    <p style="color: lightblue">This is a project i started because I am currently learning <b><a
                style="color: lightblue;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></b>
        (HyperText Markup Language), the first step on
        the way to learning front end web development.</p>
    <p style="color: lightblue">I will continue by adding <b><a style="color: lightblue;"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a></b>, <b><a style="color: lightblue;"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></b> and
        <b><a style="color: lightblue;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React(JavaScript_library">React<a></b> as I
        learn more.
    </p>
    <p style="color: lightblue">A side benefit could in time be to share the work I did while traing to become a
        helicopter Certified Flight Instructor, or CFI for short.</p>
    <p style="color: lightblue">Initially my plan is to create a website that lists out categories of content or a
        header if you will, for everything I plan to share.</p>
    <p style="color: lightblue">My long term goal is to gradually fill in content from my CFI binder, handouts and other
        knowledge i have gained
        through my flight training and working as a flight instructor.</p>
    <p style="color: lightblue">Then I plan on integrating this content using <strong>CSS</strong> and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> as I learn
        those languages.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">CFI Binder</h3>
    <p style="color: lightblue">This chaptered document will be the main body of this website. It contains all the
        knowledge an airman or
        airwoman (come on, it's time) is required to know in order to legally act as a CFI inside the FAA regulations
        that govern aviation in the USA.</p>

    <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Articles</h3>
    <p style="color: lightblue">This section will contain an article written by me, that helped me learn a subject that
        was really confusing to
        me during training, namely the required awareness tring for the robinson helicopters.</p>

    <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Hand-outs</h3>
    <p style="color: lightblue">This section will contain various handouts that I wrote while training to become a
        flight instructor.</p>

    <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Further resources</h3>
    <p style="color: lightblue">Here I will just put <em>everything</em> that I want to include, but doesn't fit into
        any of the other
        categories.</p>
    <p style="color: lightblue">This is my favourite book on helicopter flight: <b><a style="color: lightblue;"
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Helicopter-Flight-W-J-Wagtendonk/dp/1560276495">Priciples of
                Helicopter Flight by W.J. Wagtendonk</a></b></p>
